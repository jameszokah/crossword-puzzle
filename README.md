### Project Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter project structure, with the main components being:

- **lib folder**: Contains the Dart code for the application.

- **assets folder**: Contains assets such as background images.

- **pubspec.yaml**: Defines the dependencies and assets used in the project.

### Features

1. **Crossword Puzzle Generation**: Dynamically generates crossword puzzles based on predefined word sets.

2. **User Input Handling**: Allows users to interact with the puzzle by tapping on cells to input letters.

3. **Scoring System**: Tracks and scores users based on the correctness and speed of their answers.

4. **Timer**: Provides a count down timer to make the game more engaging and challenging.
